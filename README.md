**TRAP_npc_polyzone** is a script for FiveM that allows you to:

* Easily create custom polygons (polyzones) in-game.
* Automatically clean **vehicles and peds (NPCs)** inside the zone.
* Visualize zones in real-time with green walls and corner markers.
* Configure multiple zones with independent options.

---


ðŸ’¡ **Perfect for:**
Hereâ€™s a polished version of your description with your additions integrated:

---

**Perfect for:**

* Garages or RP shops to prevent NPCs or stray vehicles.
* Secure zones for RP missions or events.
* Precisely controlling entities for enhanced RP immersion.
* Removing wandering NPCs in an MLO or any area.

---

If you want, I can also rewrite it in a slightly **more professional GitHub style** for your README, so it reads even cleaner and enticing. Do you want me to do that?

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

* **Multi-zone support**: Configure multiple polyzones individually.
* **Optimized**: Cleans only nearby entities to reduce performance impact.
* **3D Debug**: In-game visualization with vertical walls and corner markers.
* **Easy to configure**: All zones are set up in `config.lua`.
* **Extensible**: Ready for logs, notifications, or integration with other scripts.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Installation

1. Copy the `TRAP_npc_polyzone` folder into your `resources` directory.
2. Add to `server.cfg`:

   ```cfg

   ```
3. Configure your polyzones in `config.lua`.
4. Start the server and enable **Config.Debug = true** to visualize zones in-game.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Configuration

```lua
Config.PolyZones = {
test = {
        points = {
            {x = -2054.48, y = -432.36},
            {x = -1989.66, y = -485.78},
            {x = -2051.72, y = -562.86},
